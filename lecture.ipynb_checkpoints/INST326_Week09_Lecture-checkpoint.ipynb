    "# Why This Matters Right Now\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Project 3 Challenge:**\n",
    "- Due Week 10 (November 23) - **Less than two weeks!**\n",
    "- Requires inheritance hierarchies with polymorphic behavior\n",
    "- Team of 3-4 people must coordinate class design and implementation\n",
    "- Need architectural decisions BEFORE code starts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project 4 Coming Soon**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Double Challenge:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Challenge 1: WHAT CLASSES?\n",
    "→ \"What entities exist in our domain?\"\n",
    "→ \"Which ones need inheritance hierarchies?\"\n",
    "→ \"What's a class vs. just data?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenge 2: HOW TO COORDINATE?\n",
    "→ \"How do we ensure classes work together?\"\n",
    "→ \"Who implements what?\"\n",
    "→ \"How do we avoid integration disasters?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Today's Goals:**\n",
    "1. Learn to identify what classes your project needs\n",
    "2. Learn how ABCs enable team coordination\n",
    "3. Leave with a clear plan for Project 3"

    "# Part 1: ABCs as Team Contracts\n",
    "## (12 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Team Coordination Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine your team is building a library management system with an inheritance hierarchy:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Team roles:**\n",
    "- **Alice** implements `Book` class\n",
    "- **Bob** implements `Journal` class\n",
    "- **Carlos** implements `DVD` class\n",
    "- **Diana** implements `LibraryManager` that coordinates them all\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without a contract:**\n",
    "- Diana: \"Does your class have a `check_out()` method?\"\n",
    "- Alice calls hers `checkout()`, Bob uses `borrow()`, Carlos uses `rent()`\n",
    "- Diana has to write different code for each type\n",
    "- Integration = nightmare of special cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**With an ABC contract:**\n",
    "- Team meets once, designs `LibraryItem` ABC together\n",
    "- ABC says: \"ALL items must have `checkout_item()` method\"\n",
    "- Everyone implements independently\n",
    "- Python enforces the contract - won't let incomplete classes exist\n",
    "- Diana writes ONE version that works polymorphically with ALL items\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an Abstract Base Class?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an ABC as a **legally binding team contract** written in code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cannot be instantiated** - it's a template, not a real object\n",
    "2. **Defines required methods** - \"Every subclass MUST implement these\"\n",
    "3. **Can include concrete methods** - \"Here's shared functionality everyone inherits\"\n",
    "4. **Python enforces it** - Incomplete implementations fail at class definition\n",
    "5. **Enables polymorphism** - Write code once, works with any valid subclass\n",
    "\n",
    "## ABC Benefits for Team Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. One Design Meeting, Not Constant Coordination\n",
    "- Team designs ABC together (1 hour meeting)\n",
    "- Everyone understands the contract\n",
    "- Then work happens independently for days\n",
    "- **Saves:** 10+ hours of coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Automatic Contract Enforcement\n",
    "- Python checks implementations automatically\n",
    "- Errors caught when class is defined, not during integration\n",
    "- No \"I forgot to implement that method\" surprises\n",
    "- **Saves:** Hours of integration debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Clear Responsibilities\n",
    "- ABC shows exactly what each class must do\n",
    "- Prevents \"who's doing what?\" confusion\n",
    "- Reduces merge conflicts\n",
    "- **Result:** Cleaner git history, fewer conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Polymorphic Integration\n",
    "- Manager classes work with ABC interface\n",
    "- Don't need to know about specific implementations\n",
    "- Add new subclasses without modifying manager\n",
    "- **Result:** Truly modular, extensible code"

    "### 1. Class Identification Comes First\n",
    "- Identify domain entities\n",
    "- Find behavioral hierarchies (not just data variations)\n",
    "- Distinguish \"is-a\" relationships needing inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. ABCs Enable Team Coordination\n",
    "- One design meeting replaces weeks of coordination\n",
    "- Python enforces contract automatically\n",
    "- Independent work with guaranteed integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Design Process\n",
    "- Identify required behaviors (what manager needs)\n",
    "- Decide abstract (varies) vs concrete (shared)\n",
    "- Add properties for required data\n",
    "- Use concrete methods for shared algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Implementation Strategy\n",
    "- Design ABC together\n",
    "- Implement subclasses independently\n",
    "- Integrate through polymorphism\n",
    "- Test against contract\n",

    "\n",
    "### Removed\n",
    "- **Template methods** from Part 4\n",
    "  - Not essential for Project 3\n",
    "  - Advanced pattern that can wait\n",

    "## Teaching Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2 (Class Identification)\n",
    "- **Critical for students:** Most struggle here first\n",
    "- **Interactive:** Ask students what entities they see\n",
    "- **Live examples:** Use their project domains\n",
    "- **Common mistakes:** Point out data vs. behavior confusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 7 (Expanded Workshop)\n",
    "- **Make it practical:** Students work on THEIR projects\n",
    "- **Circulate and help:** Answer design questions\n",
    "- **Share examples:** Have 2-3 teams share their approach\n",
    "- **Emphasize urgency:** Project due in 13 days!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Teaching Points\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Concepts\n",
    "1. **Class identification precedes ABC design** - can't design interface without knowing what classes exist\n",
    "2. **Behavior ≠ data** - biggest source of over-engineering\n",
    "3. **ABCs are team contracts** - not just technical feature\n",
    "4. **Planning time saves debugging time** - emphasize ROI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Student Struggles\n",
    "- **Too many classes:** Every data variation becomes a class\n",
    "- **Too few classes:** One god-class doing everything\n",
    "- **Missing hierarchies:** Don't see inheritance opportunities\n",
    "- **Data as classes:** Genre becomes a class instead of attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intervention Points\n",
    "- Part 2, Step 3: **Stop and check** - are they confusing behavior and data?\n",
    "- Part 7, Question 2: **Group discussion** - which hierarchies are real?\n",
    "- Part 7, Question 6: **Assignment check** - is work distributed fairly?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2\n",
    "- Poll: \"How many classes does your project need?\"\n",
    "- Discussion: \"Which of these needs inheritance?\"\n",
    "- Examples: Students suggest entities, class analyzes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 7\n",
    "- **5-minute team huddle:** Discuss entities\n",
    "- **Share one decision:** Each team shares hierarchy choice\n",
    "- **Q&A:** Address specific project questions\n",
    "\n",
    "## ADHD-Friendly Adaptations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "- Clear numbered questions\n",
    "- Decision frameworks with yes/no paths\n",
    "- Concrete examples for each domain\n",
    "- Action items with specific dates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engagement\n",
    "- Frequent code execution\n",
    "- Workshop activity (hands-on)\n",
    "- Real project application (immediately useful)\n",
    "- Checklist format for action items\n",

    "## Assessment Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "**This Week:**\n",
    "- Exercise 9: Plant polymorphism + LibraryItem ABC design\n",
    "- AI Journal 9: Document class identification & ABC design process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project 3 (Due Week 10):**\n",
    "- Class identification (architecture)\n",
    "- ABC with abstract methods/properties\n",
    "- Multiple concrete implementations\n",
    "- Polymorphic manager class\n",
    "- Evidence of team coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Coordination\n",
    "\n",
    "Lab should:\n",
    "1. Quick ABC implementation practice (20 min)\n",
    "2. Team design session (30 min)\n",
    "   - Work through Questions 1-6\n",
    "   - Draft ABC skeleton\n",
    "   - Assign work\n",
    "3. TA reviews each team's plan (15 min rotating)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Every team leaves lab with ABC drafted\n",
    "\n",
    "## Success Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Students leave able to:\n",
    "- ✓ Identify entities in their domain\n",
    "- ✓ Recognize inheritance opportunities\n",
    "- ✓ Distinguish behavior from data\n",
    "- ✓ Design ABC with team\n",
    "- ✓ Implement concrete classes independently\n",
    "- ✓ Plan Project 3 timeline\n",
    "- ✓ Know exactly what to do this week\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Issues & Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue:** Students rush class identification\n",
    "**Solution:** \"Stop. This IS the architecture. Get it right!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue:** Teams don't schedule meeting\n",
    "**Solution:** \"Use lab time. TAs will help design.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue:** Confusion on behavior vs. data\n",
    "**Solution:** Multiple examples, test with \"different method or different value?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue:** Teams want to start coding immediately\n",
    "**Solution:** \"2 hours planning saves 20 hours debugging. Plan first!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Follow-Up\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monday announcement:**\n",
    "\"How many teams have scheduled their design meeting? Do it today!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wednesday check:**\n",
    "\"How many teams have their ABC drafted? Lab is your deadline!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Monday:**\n",
    "\"How's integration going? Composition lecture will help finalize.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Message to Reinforce\n",
    "\n",
    "**The planning IS the work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor planning = 40 hours of painful debugging\n",
    "Good planning = 20 hours of smooth development\n",
    "\n",
