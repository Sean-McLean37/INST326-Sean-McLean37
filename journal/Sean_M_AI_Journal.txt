Week 2, Entry #1
This week I made some usage of AI during my coding for the first time this semester. As I was completing the weekly exercises, I came across a question that was unfamiliar (print a fixed width label so that words align, this ultimately ended up being accomplished using the f-format feature). I was not aware that this was even a feature in python, as had I ever seen width mentioned with regards to printing (this material wasn't covered in my 126 section last semester), so I prompted perplexity AI to provide me code that allows printed statements to be adjusted to a set width, and the code it returned was : print(f"Title: {title:<30}  Author: {author:<20}") , which signaled to me that I needed to be using the f formatter and adding the :<num after each variable encased in the variable brackets. After this I coded my final solution with different numbers, and noted in my notebook that this was a feature you could use when f-formatting.
