Week 2, Entry #1
This week I made some usage of AI during my coding for the first time this semester. As I was completing the weekly exercises, I came across a question that was unfamiliar (print a fixed width label so that words align, this ultimately ended up being accomplished using the f-format feature). I was not aware that this was even a feature in python, as had I ever seen width mentioned with regards to printing (this material wasn't covered in my 126 section last semester), so I prompted perplexity AI to provide me code that allows printed statements to be adjusted to a set width, and the code it returned was : print(f"Title: {title:<30}  Author: {author:<20}") , which signaled to me that I needed to be using the f formatter and adding the :<num after each variable encased in the variable brackets. After this I coded my final solution with different numbers, and noted in my notebook that this was a feature you could use when f-formatting.

Week 3, Entry #2
This week I made a couple more minor usages of AI in my weekly exercises. The first instance was when I couldnt recall which function to use to find the index of characters in a string, so I looked up what that function was, and Google Gemini returned the result that there are two functions (.index() for lists, .find() for strings). Once I remembered that I was able to advance quickly through the exercises, until I reached the later exercise involving the enforcement of the title casing, where I couldnt remember that function either, which I again prompted gemini to provide me with (its the string.title() function), before quickly implementing the function in my response to the question. I probably need to freshen up on my functions knowledge a little bit, remembering what does what.
